# Civilization

*Civilization* is a mod inspired by the Towny plugin and the turn-based strategy game Civilization 5. 

## But why?
Many players, including myself, enjoy immersive worldbuilding, roleplay, and rich player-on-player 'political' 
interaction. The problem is that Towny alone only offers so much in terms of these things; especially outside
of roleplay. Other plugins may be added to solve these problems, but for any matter involving war or management
of a claim, immersion is often broken; especially when staff are required to moderate such things. A great
example of this is the geopolitical worldbuilding roleplay server Stoneworks MC, whose staff team is often
subject to great ire from the community due to the former's necessary intervention in server affairs. 
Having to wait for staff to make decisions on your behalf robs the player of their participation in the
matter, thus breaking immersion.

## So what's the solution?
*Civilization* aims to provide an experience oriented towards players seeking the aforementioned things.
The key difference is that *Civilization* aims to give complete power to the players in terms of the decisions
they make. *Civilization* provides land claiming based on player activity and settlement stats, but also
makes a distinction between owners of cities and the state, allowing for more organic development of
internal civil strife or war. 
## How does the mod work? Why is it like that?
*Civilization* targets a couple key problems: 
- providing nuanced but organic player interactions, especially involving war & conflict
- providing an organic and rewarding claim system
- fairly accounting for the fact that not all players have time to dump into Minecraft 24/7
- fairly nerfing the influence of the few 'grind' players who can completely define the experience for many
